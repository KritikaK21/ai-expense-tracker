## 🚀 How It Works

1. **User talks to Alexa** 📢  
   ➤ Example: _"I spent 500 on groceries"_  

2. **Alexa Skill triggers Lambda**  
   ➤ Lambda handles backend and AI logic.  

3. **Expense is stored securely in Firebase** 🔒  

4. **AI Model auto-categorizes expense**  
   ➤ Example: "groceries" recognized as "Food" 🍕  

5. **Analytics ready for future dashboards!** 📊

## 🧠 AI/ML Model
- Built using **Scikit-learn**.
- Trained on real-life expense patterns.
- Models and vectorizers are stored securely (excluded from repo for safety).
- Example categories: `Food`, `Medical`, `Shopping`, `Bills`, `Entertainment`, `Transport`, etc.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy
- 🚫 **Secrets & Credentials** are **excluded** via `.gitignore`.
- Firebase & AI models are **used locally or securely stored in cloud**.

---

## 📊 Future Scope & Integrations
- 🌩️ **AWS Lambda + DynamoDB for storage**
- 🧠 **AWS SageMaker for AI Model Hosting**
- 🔔 **AWS SNS for notifications on budget limits**
- 📈 **Amplify/QuickSight Dashboards** for analytics
- ✅ **Full Serverless Expense Tracking System**
